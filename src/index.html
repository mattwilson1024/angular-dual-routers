  <p>This example is a hybrid app using both AngularJS (grey) and Angular (blue) components.</p>
  <p>The "Movies" route is handled by Angular, while the "Actors" route is handled by AngularJS. The dotted lines show the two router outlets.</p>
  <p>The links allow you to navigate between the two pages, which works correctly provided they are [routerLink] directives and not just normal hyperlinks.</p>
  <p class="bold">Problem: If you start on the actors page and navigate to "#/movies" by changing the URL, the component will not load until you click on the page.</p>
